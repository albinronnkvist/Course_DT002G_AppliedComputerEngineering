# DT002G - Applied Computer Engineering

This course provided hands-on experience in developing practical applications within the field of computer engineering. 
Over the duration of the course, I engaged in multiple phases of the software development lifecycle, including project proposals, Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), implementation, documentation, testing, and deployment.

## Final Project â€“ IAM Template Suite

For the final project, I collaborated with [Piran Amedi](https://github.com/amedipiran) to develop an IAM template suite designed to automate the provisioning of secure, credential-free workload identities in Microsoft Entra ID and Azure. 
Built using Pulumi and C# .NET, the suite addresses common challenges around manual configurations and long-lived static credentials.

### Try it out

Initially developed in a private GitLab repository, the project has now been relocated here for demonstration and sharing purposes. The template suite is available in the [IamTemplateSuite folder](./IamTemplateSuite) and can be downloaded from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hoolit.Templates.IamTemplateSuite). 

### Documentation

More details on the design, implementation, and outcomes can be found in the [final report](./FinalReport.pdf) and [presentation slides](./Presentation.pdf).
The [SRS](./SRS.pdf) is also available, which provided the foundation for the project.
